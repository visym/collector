# Face Detection

The original caffe face detection model [1] was improved [2] and open sourced by Huaizu Jiang and Erik Learned-Miller at UMass Amherst, and converted to pytorch and open sourced by Systems and Technology Research [3]. The resnet-101 face recognition model was trained and open sourced by Systems and Technology Research [3].
