## Visym Collector

[Visym Collector](https://visym.com/collector) is a mobile app for collecting large scale, on-demand and consented video datasets of people for visual AI applications. Collector is able to record, annotate and verify custom video datasets of rarely occuring activities for training visual AI systems, at an order of magnitude lower cost than existing methods. Our distributed data collection team is spread over five continents and fifty countries to collect unbiased datasets for global visual AI applications.
   
Visym Collector provides:  

* On-demand collection of rare classes  
* Simultaneous video recording, annotation and verification into a single platform  
* Consented videos of people for ethical dataset curation
* Python tools for hard negative mining and live model testing in PyTorch

Our goal is to make these datasets available to the computer vision research community for the purpose of advancing the state-of-the-art.
